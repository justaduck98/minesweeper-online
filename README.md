##Usere Experience (UX)

### Project goals

* The website should have a neat, simple and intuative design to represent the simplicity of the game.

* Display a playable, working game of MineSweeper with different difficulties and various amount of bombs.

* Allow the user to reveal tiles, mark flags, find bombs and make it easy to keep playing.

### User Stories

* As a site visitor, the purpose of the website should be clear, and figuring out how to play the game should take no less than 5 minutes. 

* As an avid MineSweep Player, I would like to change up the difficulties for varying how hard the game should be. 

* As a travelling worker, I would like to enjoy my favorite game while on the go on my phone.

### Color Scheme

The main colors used for this project are: Yellow(#FFAA55), grey(#454545) and white(#FFFFFF). The colours should take away distractions from the game and allow users to focus on enjoying the game.

### Typography

The fonts used in this website are Times New Roman and Arial. They should give a familiar feeling and a clean expression. They are also considered safe fonts meaning they will always display.

## Features

### General

* Responsive design across all device sizes and units, from mobile up to desktops.

* Subtle coloring that makes it clear to the user what actions they can take on the website and no distracting elements.

* **Header**
  ![Header image]

  - The header is simply the text: "MineSweeper, The Classic Game To Test Your Superior Skills!"
  - The header is responsive and shrinks both in size and adapts well to mobile, tablet and laptop screens.
* **Footer**
  - The project scope doesn't require a footer as it doesn't provide any game functionality for the user. 
  - One could aruge that difficulty buttons could be part of the footer, but to increase development efficiency, I have chosen to keep it as a part of the main code.
 
### Landing Page

* **1st Header**
  - The text is used to display how many bombs are present in the loaded game, to allow the user to know how many bombs are on the playing field.

* **The Game**
  - The game is loaded in a 5x5 by default when the page loads, to allow the user to quickly start playing if they are limited on time.
 
* **Game Text**
  - This text allows the user to know what difficulty they are currently playing, and is responsive to display the correct text as difficulty changes.
  - This text will also be changed to "Would You Like To Play Again?" when a game is lost.
 
* **Difficulty Buttons**
  - These buttons will generate a new playing field, 5x5, 7x7, 9x9 and show it to the user.
  - These buttons also work as play again options as there is no play again button currently.
